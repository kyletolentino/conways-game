- Setup git on Engineering Workstation (EWS)
- np.random.randit to generate 0s and 1s randomly
- need to figure out way to store previous state while iterating

- three cases: (1)Corners, (2)Sides/Edges, (3)Everything else
- Corners have 3 neighbors
- Sides/Edges have 5 neighbors
- Everything else has 8 neighbors (holds true for even x even matrices, par 2x2)

- 0x0, 1x1, 2x2 special cases (DONT FORGET)


2/6/2020
- Initialized git for source control
- doing 2 for loops (x,y), might consider np.ndenumerate
